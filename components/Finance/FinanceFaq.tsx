    question: 'Does enrolling in the program affect my credit score?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Nope! During the onboarding process we will only conduct a soft pull on
        your credit report, which will not affect your personal credit score.

    question: 'Why do I need to provide my bank connection details?',

      <>
        Securely connecting your business bank account allows us to review your
        cashflow and determine your best loan offers.

  {
    question: 'When should I expect to receive a loan offer?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Once you are enrolled into the program, we will be actively analyzing
        your financials and creating pre-approved offers that work best for your
        business needs. We do this to help you avoid debt trap. Loan offers are
        usually provided within less than 48 hours.

    question: 'How do I repay the loan?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <>
          At the moment we support monthly loan repayment once you agree to the
          loan payment schedule. A fixed amount will be automatically deducted
          from the bank you linked during the onboarding.
        </>
        <>
          In the near future, you can also choose to pay back the loan as a
          fixed percentage of your daily sales until the loan is fully repaid.
